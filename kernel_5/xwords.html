<h3>Multitasking</h3>
<a HREF="./license.html">license</a>
<p>
How tasks are dealt with sets the scene for the whole system.
Tasks can be schedule by multiple interrupt sources. Each interrupt
source is allocated a different priority. All interrupt sources have
a higher priority than the clock interrupt. The clock interrupt
is divided into 3 sub priorities. The lowest priority consumes all
spare cpu time.
Within a priority task sheduling is on a co-oporaive basis. That is 
the task gets the CPU until it releases it. Task switching within
a level is done at FORTH word boundries making in necessary to
save the FORTH enviroment only.
</p>
<p>
Switching between levels is done on a pre-emtive basis, the full machine
state is saved with no reference to what is actually running.
</p>

<a name="xbase"></a>
<h5>xbase</h5>
<p>
	The clock interrupt interrupts the system every 10d msec. The interrupt does not raise
	the task priority level unless the number of interrupts equals the value stored
	in xbase. For example if xbase is set to 10d the clock will raise the 
	priority level every 100d msecs.
</p>

<h5>sleep wake</h5>
<p>
The following are constants stored in the tasks STATUS to control
the state of the task. 
</p>
<p>
29 Nov 2001 They are offsets into a switch vector table. The vectors include a level_switch code.
The level_switch code is only used by teh system. See the file traps.html
</p>
	<pre> <code>

<p>
 The multitasker has several list. List zero has the highest priority, list
 on the next highest and so on. _xlevel points to the list currently running.
</p>
	<pre> <code>
	ram_variable _xlevel
	</code> </pre>
<p>
The priority to be executed when multitasker to be restated,
this is looked at when ever the
the processor state moves from supervisor to user.
</p>
	<pre> <code>
	ram_variable _xlevel_next
	</code> </pre>

<a name="xnext"></a>
<h5>xnext (suspend a task)</h5>
<p>
We may not have protected memory, but boy we have fast task switches.
This word saves the forth enviroment on the parameter stack, saves the current 
stack pointer into the user area and returns to the multitasker. 
</p>

	<pre> <code>
	CODE xnext ( --)
		LP R -) MOV  \ local pointer
		OP R -) MOV  \ object pointer
		S R -) MOV
                NOP          \ so at least the error is displayed with the correct U

                02 # TRAP

                R )+ OP MOV
                R )+ LP MOV
        NEXT
	</code> </pre>
<h5>stop</h5>
<p>
Brings things to an end
</p>
	<pre> <code>
	CODE stop
		00 # TRAP
	NEXT
	</code> </pre>

<a name="xpause"></a>
<h5>xpause</h5>
<p>   
Exit to the multitasker, the task will be restarted when things 
are looked at again.
If the task is on #clock_low this will be as soon 
as load permits. If the task is on a higher level this will be 
when the hardware restarts that level. #clock_medium
and #task_level_clock_high are looked at every 100 msecs. 
This can be altered by storing a  different value into 
<a HREF="./Kernel.html#xbase">xbase</a>. The interrupt tasks 
are only looked at when a interrrupt occures and the interrupt 
raises the priority level.
</p>

	<pre> <code>
	: status ( -- addr)
		@u activation_status
	;

	: xpause  ( --)
		wake status W!   
		xnext
	;
	</code> </pre>

<a name="xoff"></a>
<h5>xoff</h5>
<p>
Use if the task is to remain but not started again. If the task is to be restarted
by another task use xsleep.
</p>

	<pre> <code>
	: xoff ( --)    
		sleep status W!
		xnext
	;
	</code> </pre>


<a name="xsleep"></a>
<h5>xsleep</h5>
<p>
	We will not be actived unless someone else wakes us up.
	Used in the form.
</p>
	<samp>: yyyy  ..... xsleep start_something_that_can_wake_us  xpause ... ;</samp>
<p>
We do it this ways so we won't miss an event. If we start the external
activity before setting the STATUS area the external event could set it before
we do and the event will be missed forever.
</p>


	<pre> <code>
	: xsleep ( --)  
		sleep status W!
	;
	</code> </pre>
<a name="xwake"><h5>xwake</h5></a>

<p>
Use is pretty limited, used in type routines when tranferring rotating buffer characters
to input buffer, without echo.
</p>
	<pre> <code>
	: xwake ( --)
		wake status W!
	;
	</code> </pre>    


<a name="xtest"></a>
<h5>xtest</h5>
<p>
Set the STATUS to test, used in the form:
</p>
<samp>: xxxx  .....  xtest n xwait ...... ;</samp>
<p> 
Or to be more specific.
</p>
<samp> : yyyy  ..... xtest start_something_that_can_wake_us n xwait ... ; </samp>
<p>
See xtimeout? for futher clarification.
</p>

	<pre> <code>
	: xtest  ( --)  
		test user_base activation_status W! 
	;
	</code> </pre>


<a name="xwait"></a>
<h5>xwait</h5>
<p>
Take the current time, add the requested time delay 
and use that as the reactivation time. Go to sleep.
</p>


	<pre> <code>
	: xwait  ( n --)
		xclock+ @ + 
		_task_restart_time !
		xnext
	;
	</code> </pre>


<a name="xcycle"></a>
<h5>xcycle</h5>
<p>
The time is added to the last <samp>_task_restart_time</samp>
and used as the next <samp>_task_restart_time</samp>. If the number
of executions is really important then use this. It's 
use is not recommented as you gain very little ( you still
have to use the actual delay for time calculations) and the 
risks are great ( you can lose a years time and be locked
out for a year).
</p>


	<pre> <code>
	: xcycle ( n --)
		_task_restart_time @ +
		_task_restart_time !
		xnext
	;
	</code> </pre>

<a name="_xtimeout"></a>
<h5>xtimeout?</h5>
<p>
When you do an <samp>xwait</samp> for an external event, the external event changes
the STATUS to wake when the event times out. If the event didn't
time out the staus area will still be set to <samp>_test</samp>. Obviously this
word was to be used before the STATUS is altered by other multitasker
words.
</p>
<p>
flag is true if timeout
</p>

	<pre> <code>
	: xtimeout? ( --flag )
		status W@ test =
	;

	</code> </pre>

<a name="facility_variables"></a>
<h3>Facility variables</h3>
<p>
Being a multitasking system, several tasks may want to use the same resources at the
same time. Whan an item is claimed it is linked into _facility_head so that the
items can be realeased if the task aborts.A task claims a facility by having
it's user_base address written to the facility variable.
</p>
<p>
All the facilites used by a task are link back to this head.
</p>


	<pre> <code>
		uvariable	_facility_head
	</code> </pre>


<a name="grab"></a>
<h5>grab</h5>
<p>
Try and claim the facility without returning to the multitasker,
if you fail return to the multitasker and try again later.
</p>


	<pre> <code>

	: grab ( addr --)
		BEGIN
                        DUP @ status = IF	\ addr (--
				DROP
				EXIT
			THEN
			_lock_word
			DUP @
			0= IF		\ addr (--
			    status OVER !
				\ link into facility list so about can release
				_unlock_word
				_#facility_link + _facility_head link_double
				EXIT
			THEN
			_unlock_word
			xpause
		AGAIN
	;
	</code> </pre>
		

<a name="get"></a>
<h5>get</h5>
<p>
get is a little kinder to the system than grab, it returns to the multitasker
and then tries to get the facility when next started.
</p>


	<pre> <code>
	: get ( addr --)
		xpause 
		grab 
	;

	</code> </pre>

<a name="release"></a>
<h5>release</h5>
<p>
There is code that has assumed that release doesn't 
exit to the multitasker ( grab is used directly after).
We assume tasks don't release if they don't claim. 
</p>
	
	<pre> <code>
	\ There is code that depends on this definition of release
	\ if you change bump the version number
	01 CONSTANT _#release_version
	: release ( addr --)
		DUP @ 0<> IF
			DUP _#facility_link + unlink_double
			zero SWAP !
		ELSE
			DROP
		THEN
	;
	</code> </pre>
<p>
Dual port must use activation status, further the claim is not linked in
has dual port stuctures are locked in history.
</p>	
	
	<pre> <code>  
	\ Non standard

	\ There is code that has assumed that release doesn't 
	\ exit to the multitasker ( grab is used directly after)
	\ ##### get rid of when dual port stuff is sorted out
	: port_release ( addr --)
		DUP @ status = IF
			zero SWAP !
		ELSE
			DROP
		THEN
	;
	</code> </pre>

<a name="xgrab"></a>
<h5>xgrab</h5>
<p>
Try and get the facility for a little while and if not successful give up.
A flag is returned to indicate the outcome.
</p>

	<pre> <code>
	| CREATE $can't_claim ," Can't claim facility."

		BEGIN

<p>
Areas claimed in dual port must use ther activation status. Further they are not locked
in as dual port structures are locked in history.
