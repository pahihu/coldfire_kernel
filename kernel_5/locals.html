<h2>Temporary dictionaries, local data and magic numbers</h2> 

<a HREF="#local_variables">Abstract</a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>
What does:
</p>
<pre> <samp>
	@ 8 + @ 4+ !
</samp> </pre>
<p>
do?
</p>
<p>
Not many hints are there? Magic numbers don't tell you much. 
This could be a lot clearer by first describing the structure.
</p>
<pre> <samp>
zero	
	DUP CONSTANT #task_xt         CELL+
	DUP CONSTANT #task_time       CELL+
	DUP CONSTANT #task_head>      CELL+
	DROP

zero
	DUP CONSTANT #head_link	      CELL+
	DUP CONSTANT #head_name>      CELL+
	DUP CONSTANT #head_count      CELL+
	DROP

</samp> </pre>
<p>
And then using the description  to write the code.
</p>
<pre> <samp>
	@ #task_head> + @ #head_name> + !
</samp> </pre>
<p>
Now the code has some meaning, further if the structure of 
the data changes, the code will reflect the changes. 
But there is a cost. A lot of constants are added to the dictionary. 
With memory costing less than $10 a megabyte, this probably means nothing, 
but in embedded applications memory use can still matter.
</p>
<p>
One solution to the problem is <b>temporary dictionaries</b>.
</p>

<p>
COLDFORTH offers a reasonable rich syntax  for local variable 
description ( the <a HREF="http://braid.rad.jhu.edu/til/AboutBNF.html">BNF</a> characters 
are bold, a space in terminals represents white space or a new line, 
all terminals are enclosed in quotes):
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Forth_word <b>::=</b></dt>
<dl>	<b>"</b>: <b>"</b> <b><</b>name<b>></b> <b><</b>local_data_descriptor<b>></b> <b><</b>compiled_forth_code<b>></b> <b>"</b>; <b>"</b></dl>
<br>
<dt>local_data_descriptor <b>::=</b></dt>
<dl><b>"</b>{ <b>"</b>  <b>{</b> <b><</b>interpreted_forth_code<b>></b> <b>|</b> <b><</b>type<b>></b> <b><</b>name<b>></b> <b>}</b> <b>[</b> 
<b>"</b>-- <b>"</b> <b>{</b> <b><</b>interpreted_forth_code<b>></b> <b>|</b> <b><</b>type<b>></b> <b><</b>name<b>></b><b>}</b>  <b>]</b> 
	<b>[</b>  <b>"</b>}{ <b>"</b> <b>{</b> <b><</b>interpreted_forth_code<b>></b> <b>|</b> <b><</b>type<b>></b> <b><</b>name<b>></b> <b>}</b> <b>]</b>
<b>"</b>} <b>"</b></dl>
<br>
<dt>type <b>::=</b></dt>
<dl><b>"</b>variable <b>"</b> <b>|</b> <b>"</b>value <b>"</b> <b>|</b> <b>"</b>2variable <b>"</b>
<b>|</b> <b><</b>number<b>></b> <b>"</b>bytes <b>"</b> <b>|</b> <b><</b>structure_name<b>></b> <b>"</b>structure <b>"</b></dl>
</dl>
<p>
This syntax allows us to describe inputs that will be transferred to 
the local data area ( types between <i>{</i> and <i>--</i>), 
outputs that will be transferred from the local data area ( types between <i>--</i> and <i>}{</i>), 
and local data areas that will be used by the word ( types between <i>}{</i> and <i>}</i>).
The order the input and output stack is described follows the FORTH conventions, 
unlike the method suggested in the ANS standard. 
</p>
<h4>An Example</h4>
<pre> <samp>
: foo  { value %input1@ value %input2@ -- variable %output1  variable %output2 }{
	variable                 _%temp1
	my_struct structure      _%my_struct
	value                    _%temp2@

	10 CONSTANT #my_type

	}
	
	%input1@  %output1 !
	#my_type  %output% !
;
</samp> </pre>
<p>
This is implemented using temporary dictionaries.  This paper aims to show how 
powerful the <b><</b>local_data_descriptor<b>></b> is, and how simple it is to implement. 
Temporary dictionaries can also be used to store constants with file scope 
( temporary dictionary is destroyed when the file is closed), and  
constants with application scope ( temporary dictionary is destroyed just 
before the prompt is printed). We will deal with the <b><</b>local_data_descriptor<b>></b>
because that is an interesting temporary dictionary application.
</p>


<h3>The temporary dictionary</h3>
<p>
The discussion will focus on COLDFORTH. COLDFORTH is a subroutine threaded forth, 
with a reasonable conventional structure. When creating a temporary dictionary, 
COLDFORTH has to deal with the following.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The wordlist has to be temporary as the words linked in will die. 
When a temporary dictionary is created a wordlist is created in the temporary dictionary. 
<li>If wordlists are linked into a common list ( as they are in COLDFORTH) 
the link is best implemented as a double link list so the temporary wordlist 
can be removed with ease when the temporary dictionary is destroyed. 
<li>The standard words compile to a code area ( the next address is
 unnamed in the ANS standard, but lets call it <i>CHERE</i>) and a data area, 
 the next address is given by <i>HERE</i>. If using temporary dictionaries both 
 these words have to have one more degree of indirection.  
 In a conventional system <i>HERE</i> might be defined:	
<pre><samp>
: HERE 'h @ ;
</samp></pre> 
In a system using temporary dictionaries HERE could be defined:
<pre> <samp>
: HERE 'h> @ @ ;
</samp> </pre> 
<i>CHERE</i> would have to be defined  in a similar way. When compiling to the temporary 
dictionary both <i>CHERE</i> and <i>HERE</i> would return the same 
address as the first indirection 
would point to the same cell. 
Quite neat really. You can have a separate data and code space when compiling to 
the permanent dictionary, and common code and data space when compiling to the 
temporary dictionary.
<li>If you do a top of  dictionary test, the limit has to  be altered to reflect the end of the temporary area.
<li>  <b>last</b>; the last problem is specific to <b><</b>local_data_descriptor<b>></b>
and shall be dealt with under its own heading.
</ul>
<p>
Where do you get your temporary dictionary memory? <i>ALLOCATE</i> would be a good place to start.
</p>
<p>
So there it is; one more level of indirection for <i>HERE</i> and if you have it <i>CHERE</i>,
wordlists that can be created and destroyed, and a top of dictionary value that is a 
pointer. Not much really.
</p>
<h3>last</h3>
<p>
Like probable every fig FORTH derivative COLDFORTH has a <i>last</i> value. 
Ours points to the thread that was last used ( probable like all fig FORTH derivatives that 
use a threaded dictionary structure). This value is needed by <i>;</i> and other words to 
manipulate the last created head. As <b><</b>local_data_descriptor<b>></b>
adds words to the local dictionary, one of the actions of  <i>{</i> has to 
be the saving of <i>last</i>, one of the actions of <i>}</i> has to 
be <i>last</i>'s restoration.
</p>

<h3>The local data area</h3>
<p>
Local data areas are best pointed to. The ANS standard doesn't allow you to 
use >R and R> within words using locals, however it does require the implementers 
to make locals available within a DO loop. 
If you use the return stack for loop parameters, you basically have to use a 
local data area pointer to meet the DO loop requirement. 
If you have a pointer there is no need for the >R and R> restriction 
(but I am sure others have reflected on the wisdom of the ANS local implementation).  
It doesn't matter if you implement the pointer as a register, 
a user variable or a cell ( assuming a single thread).
</p>
<p> 
The data areas can be built on the return stack ( the fastest option for 
the 68K and coldfire family), on the heap ( if ALLOCATE and FREE are fast enough)
or in a memory data area. The important concept is, <b>a data frame is created 
on word entry and destroyed on word exit</b>.
</p>
<p>
If you use a local pointer ( LP ) you have to save the old LP value when you 
create the new local data area.  If you CATCH, the LP value has to be part of the 
frame to be restored. If you task switch at the FORTH level the LP value 
becomes part of the issue.
</p>
<p>
Correct handling of the LP is probably the biggest issue in systems that 
aren't handling a local data area frame. 
</p>
<p>
COLDFORTH has LP in a register and it creates the data areas 
on the return stack.
</p>
<p>
Having a LP removes the restrictions on return stack usage added by local variables, 
this alone makes its implementation worth while.
</p>

<h3>Transferring data to and from the "local data frame"</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
This is  processor dependent. The 68K and coldfire family have a LINK instruction, 
this instruction only gives you one option. 
After the LINK instruction LP points to the top of the local data frame ( high address) 
and the  return stack pointer points to the bottom ( low address).  
On word entry, if you save data into the bottom of the local data frame then you 
can use the return stack and parameter stack as your start address and do 
an ascending memory copy.  On exit if you use the top of the data frame for 
output then the LP and return stack registers can be used as a base and a 
descending copy will transfer the data. This only leaves one place 
for the local data area proper, the middle of the frame.
</p>

<h3>So what does { do?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Creates a local dictionary. 
<li>Saves last.
<li>Sets the user variables, _%local_input_bytes, _%local_output_bytes and 
_%local_data_bytes to zero. 
<li>Sets %local_use to true.
<li>Moves the system into interpret state, 
<li>Adds the local_input vocabulary to the search order.
<li>And sets CURRENT to the wordlist contained in the temporary dictionary. 
</ul>
<p>
The local_input vocabulary has the allowed "type" words. These versions of
"type" update <i>_%local_input_bytes</i>, create local dictionary entries that 
create children that know what value <i>_%local_input_bytes</i> had. 
The child words lay down code that reference the input area of the local data frame. 
</p>
<pre> <code>
	: {  ( --)
		\ preserve system state that needs preserving
		STATE @ _%local_entry_state !
		last @  _%local_entry_last !
		\ this uvariable lets  EXIT and ; know that the 
		\ local data area has been used.
		TRUE _%local_use !
		zero _%local_input_bytes !
		zero _%local_output_bytes !
		zero _%local_data_bytes !
		\ Set interpreting
		[COMPILE] [
		\ create a temporary dictionary
		_local_dictionary
		\ add new words to the temporary dicationary.
		ALSO &local
		DEFINITIONS
		\ note that &local isn't in the search order at this stage
		\ Add the wordlist contain acceptable types for this stage 
		\ to the search order
		&local_input
	; IMMEDIATE
</code> </pre>
<p>
Example of a word that is found in the local_input vocabulary. This is taken from COLDFORTH, 
as COLDFORTH is subroutine threaded, the code compiled to set up the local data area is 
also valid in a code word. We take advantage of this by having local data words 
return an offset when in interpret state. As is usual the COLDFORTH assembler works 
in interpret state
</p>
	<pre> <code>
	: variable   \ parent ( --) 
				\ child STATE=0 ( -- offset)
				\ child STATE=1 ( -- address)
		CREATE	\ header in local dictionary
		IMMEDIATE \ mark new word as immediate
		\ As we are building structure down in memory we align after allocation.
		\ Particularly relevent for structures.
		_%local_input_bytes @ CELL+ 4aligned _%local_input_bytes !
		_%local_input_bytes @ ,
		DOES>
			\ offset relative to	 LP
			@ \ value stored in pfa
			_%local_output_bytes @ +
			_%local_local_bytes @ + NEGATE
			STATE @ IF \ compile
				41ED W,    \ ##code nnn LP) A0 LEA
				     W,
				2D08 W,    \ ##code A0 S -) MOV
			THEN
	;
	</code> </pre>

<ul>Note that the data arrangement in the "local data frame" gives: 
<li>Data copies that are simple to implement on processors with auto increment and
decrement addressing modes. 
<li>Simple LP offset calculations, as demonstrated in the above code.
</ul>

<h3>So what does -- do?</h3>
<p>
Not much; replaces the local_input vocabulary with the local_output vocabulary. 
The local_output vocabulary has "type" words that update %local_output_bytes
and that create children that know what the current value of  _%local_output_bytes was. 
The children lay down code that reference the output data area within the local data frame.
</p>

<pre> <code>
	\ switch from input to output
	: -- 
		&local_output
	;
</code> </pre>

<h3>What does }{ do?</h3>

<p>
Change the first searched wordlist from local_input or local_output to local_data. These words update 
_%local_data_bytes and create children that know what was the current value of 
_%local_data_bytes was. The child lay down code that reference the local data area.
By convention, <i>constant</i>s with word scope are created between <i>}{</i> and <i>}</i>. 
</p>
<pre> <code>
	\ switch from output, or input to data
	: }{
		&local_data
	;
</code> </pre>
<h3>What does } do?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Restore previous <i>STATE</i>
<li>Restore <i>last</i>
<li>Restores the dictionary pointers so they point to the permanent dictionary, restore current.
<li>Lays down the code to set up the required stack frame ( total size: 
<i>_%local_input_bytes @  _%local_output_bytes @ + _%local_data_bytes @ +</i>).
<li>Lays down the code to transfer the input parameter stack data into the stack frame.
<li>Add the temporary dictionary wordlist to the search order.
</ul>
<p> 
The last action is not done in a ANS standard way ( the whole concept fails that test),
the ANS standard requires the local variables to be searched first and the search order 
to be independent of the SEARCH order word set. We saw no way of doing this 
without adding additional code to find. Our code simple makes &local, 
the first searched vocabulary.
</p>
<pre> <code>
	: }
		\ set entry state, for : words it will be compiling
		\ for code words it will be interpreting.
		_%local_entry_state @ STATE !
		\ last should point to the main word
		_%local_entry_last @ last !

		\ back to the normal dictionary
		_exit_local_dictionary

		\ add  entry code
		_%local_use @ IF
			_%local_input_bytes @
			_%local_output_bytes @ +
			_%local_local_bytes @ +  NEGATE
			4E55	W,		\ ##code lp nnn # LINK
					W,
			_%local_input_bytes @ IF
				_%local_input_bytes @ 4 /  
				7000 OR W,   \ ##code inputs # D0 MOV
				204F W,      \ ##code R A0 MOV
				             \ ##code BEGIN
				20DE W,      \ ##code     S )+ A0 )+ MOV
				5380 W,      \ ##code     1 # D0 SUB
				66FA W,      \ ##code EQ UNTIL
			THEN
		THEN


		\ WE add &local to the search order.
		\ This has to be allowed for on exit
		\ If _%local_use is set the system will assume &local 
		\ has been added to search order and must be removed.

		&local
	;
</code> </pre>

<h3>How are constants dealt with?</h3>
<p>
In COLDFORTH constants lay down code, they are not directly referenced if included 
in a : definition. So a constant can be created in a temporary dictionary, 
used and discarded. In all FORTHs this is not the case, if a system normally references 
constants code directly the local_input, local_output and local_data wordlists 
must contain a version of CONSTANT that doesn't have to live at runtime.
</p>

<h3>What about exit?</h3>
<p>
Even if you limit your implementation to the ANS standard, you have to put 
data somewhere on word entry, and effectively remove it on word exit. 
Things are just a little more complex now.  
</p>
If  _%locals_use @ is true ( it is set by <i>{</i> ).
<ul>
<li>Lay down code to transfer the output data from the local data area 
to the parameter stack ( _%local_output_bytes gives the count)
<li>Lay down code to remove the local data area frame.
</ul>
<p>
As the exit return address can by retrieved using the LP on the 68k/coldfire 
implementation, the use of <i>{ }</i> has one side effect; you don't have to tidy 
up the return stack on exit. The following code becomes valid:
</p>	
	<pre> <samp>
	: fred { ( n --n) }
		10 0 DO
			EXIT
		LOOP
	;
	</samp> </pre>
<p>
But not recommended, as the trick would not work on systems that didn't create their local
data areas on the return stack.
</p>

<h3>What does ; do?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Same as  EXIT, 
<li>Remove temporary wordlist from search order.
<li>Destroy local dictionary. 
</ul>

<h3>Usage experiance</h3>
<p>
The scheme under discussion offers input naming, local data areas, 
local constants, and output naming. What gets used? 
</p>
<p>
Programmers tend to use <i>value</i> for input if the input value is not to change, 
and <i>variable</i> if the data item is to be altered. 
But in general the input items are not often named. Output items 
are seldom named. The most common use is for the description of a local data area
used within the word. As in the example below. 
</p>
<pre> <samp>
: fred
	{ ( x1 x1 -- x3 ) }{
	HEX
	10 CONSTANT _#temp_buffer_size
	variable _%something
	_#temp_buffer_size bytes _%temp_buffer
	}
	some_code
;
</samp> </pre>
<p>
As this is not an option offered by the
ANS standard this is a disappointing result.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Temporary dictionaries can be used to create a system that describes a local data 
area well, and  remove magic numbers from a program. 
The implementation is not very difficult.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<a name="local_variables"><b>Temporary dictionaries, local data and magic numbers</b><br>
Charles Esson<br>
<br>
A data area local to a FORTH word could be used to reference input data stack items by name,
to provide data areas local to the word, and to describe output data items by name. 
Further for flexibility you should be able to reference the data item by address or by value. 
The ANS standard offers a small subset of these options. 
An implementation that offers all these options is described. 
The system uses temporary dictionaries, is easy to follow and is easy to implement. 
As a bonus the system provides <I>constant</I>s with word scope.<br>
