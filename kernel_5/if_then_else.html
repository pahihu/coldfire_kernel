Software that runs in several system environments often contains some 
source code that is environmentally dependent. Conditional compilation - 
the selective inclusion or exclusion of portions of the source code 
at compile time - is one technique that is often used to assist in the 
maintenance of such source code. 
</p> <p>
Conditional compilation is sometimes done with smart comments - 
definitions that either skip or do not skip the remainder of the 
line based on some test.
For example: 
</p> <p>
If 16-Bit? contains TRUE, lines preceded by 16BIT\
will be skipped. Otherwise, they will not be skipped.
</p>
<pre> <samp> 
ram_variable 16-BIT?

: 16BIT\  ( -- )  16-BIT? @  IF  POSTPONE \  THEN ;  IMMEDIATE
</samp> </pre>
<p> 
This technique works on a line by line basis, and is good for short, 
isolated variant code sequences. 
</p> <p> 
More complicated conditional compilation problems suggest a nestable method 
that can encompass more than one source line at a time. The words
included in the ANS Forth optional Programming tools extensions word 
set are useful for this purpose.

<a name="[ELSE]"></a>
<h5>ANS 15.6.2.2531 [ELSE]</h5>
<p>
Compilation: Perform the execution semantics given below.
</p>
<p>
Execution: ( "< spaces >name" ... -- )
</p>
<p>
Skipping leading spaces, parse and discard space-delimited words from 
the parse area, including nested occurrences of [IF] ... [THEN] and [IF] ...
[ELSE] ... [THEN], until the word [THEN] has been parsed and discarded. 
If the parse area becomes exhausted, it is refilled as with REFILL. [ELSE] is
an immediate word. 
<pre> <samp>
Typical use: ... flag [IF] ... [ELSE] ... [THEN] ... 
</pre> </samp>

<a name="[IF]"></a>
<h5>ANS 15.6.2.2532 [IF]</h5> 
<p>
Compilation: Perform the execution semantics given below.
</p>
<p>
Execution: ( flag | flag "< spaces >name" ... -- )
</p>
<p>
If flag is true, do nothing. Otherwise, skipping leading spaces, parse 
and discard space-delimited words from the parse area, including 
nested occurrences of [IF] ... [THEN] and [IF] ... [ELSE] ... [THEN], 
until either the word [ELSE] or the word [THEN] has been parsed and 
discarded. If the parse area becomes exhausted, it is refilled as 
with REFILL. [IF] is an immediate word. 
</p>
<p>  
An ambiguous condition exists if [IF] is POSTPONEd, or if the end of 
the input buffer is reached and cannot be refilled before the terminating 
[ELSE] or [THEN] is parsed.
