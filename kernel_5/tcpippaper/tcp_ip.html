<h2>TCP/IP, DEVICE DRIVERS and OOP</h2>
<h3>What is COLDFORTH</h3>
<P>Colour Vision Systems builds fruit handling equipment. In that market 
we build vision systems and supply reasonably complex distributed computing 
systems. The real time computers have always been based on the 68k and 
FORTH. The systems have been tied together using proprietary communication protocols.
</P>
<P>Two years ago Motorola brought the 68k family to an end. 
They announced the 68060 would be the last.
</P>
<P>
We had an OS that was tied to the 68k with over 50% of the code written in 
68k assembler. For the first time in 14 years we had to look over the fence 
and evaluate processor families offered by others, and worry about the OS.
</P>
<P>
We looked hard at the option of abandoning our OS and moving 
to a commercial solution. Unfortunately our applications require 
preemptive multitasking so the solutions offered by the major FORTH 
vendors were not suitable.
</P>
<P>
We evaluated several C based solutions but concluded the development 
model offered by FORTH had served us well. No one was looking forward 
to developing their embedded code with emulators and remote debuggers.
</P>
<P>
With our current system a service engineer can go to site and modify 
the code of the most insignificant embedded processors without any 
additional equipment. All subsystems are networked and all provide access 
to the development task, with file services being provided by a central server.
</P>
<P>We reluctantly decided to rewrite our OS in FORTH, making it as 
portable as possible.. We also decided to place the result under the 
GPLL in the hope that others may find a use for the result. Colour Vision 
Systems are not in the OS business. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to write the entire OS in FORTH and the decision to GPLL 
the code influenced the COLDFORTH design goals. 
</P>

<h3>COLDFORTH DESIGN GOALS</h3>

<OL>
<LI>Move from indirect threaded to subroutine threaded. You have to do this to 
get the speed required if all the OS is to be written in FORTH. This has been done.</LI>
<LI>Add compiler optimization. Design done, code to be written.</LI>
<LI>Add reasonable heap control, this has been done, and has been 
described in a separate paper.</LI>
<LI>A well defined structure for drivers. Done and covered briefly 
in the next section of this paper</LI>
<LI>Move to the ANSI standard, but only if the standard doesn’t reduce 
current functionality. This has been done, we have kept our own local
variable standard as it is much more useful than the system 
described by the ANSI standard. This was covered in a paper 
I presented last year.</LI>
<LI>All code included in the kernel had to be GPLL-able. I wanted 
this rule relaxed so the development could move faster, but other 
principals in the company where adamant that this was not an option.</LI>
<LI>For the OS to be useful in the long term it had to support TCP/IP. 
This is well on the way and the topic for this paper. </LI>
<LI>Local multi user file support, to be specific, a file system that 
uses flash to store the data. Done, the file system was modeled 
on the Minux file system.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The code has all been written as HTML files. Making it a simple matter 
to present it on the web. A CVS server will be put on line in the new year. </P>

<h3>IO DRIVERS</h3>

<P>An operating system should provide a framework that ties device drivers 
together and a structure to manage resources.</P>

<P>The two other papers presented this year discussed COLDFORTHs heap allocation 
and task scheduling, both resource management issues. How COLDFORTH 
device drivers are implemented heavily influences the COLDFORTH 
TCP/IP stack and is discussed here.
</P>

<P>Basically COLDFIRE device drivers are objects and the whole system 
has been designed around classes. Considerable time was spent evaluating 
the various OOP models that have been developed for FORTH. We selected 
Anton Ertl’s model, modifying it so that cross compile-able code could 
be written. We also altered word names so they met our coding standards.</P>

<P>Having used Anton’s model extensively we want to make several small 
changes to it. I am hoping these changes are influenced by a consensus 
as to what the ANSI standard OOP language should look like. 
ANSI standard word do not conflict with our coding standard because 
of rule one. No matter how irrational the ANSI standard word names is; 
use it. ANSI standard words are in capital letter, non standard names 
are in lower case. COLDFORTH is case sensitive.</P>
<P>There is however one area where we are now very inflexible. 
Polymorphism and late binding. It has to be fast. Searching for a name 
match is not an option.</P>

<h3>THE ANSI WORDS and DEVICE DRIVERS</h3>

<P>Handling of devices can be broken down to one simple requirement. 
A single function has to perform the same operation against completely different hardware. 
The ANSI standard gives the names of suitable function for I/O operation, but no guidance 
on how the functions are to be implemented. In fact without a bit of lateral thinking you may 
not see that <samp>READ-FILE</samp> is a perfectly good word to read data from any 
I/O device, be it serial or block orientated; local or remote; based on silicon or 
rotating disk based.</P>
<P>The COLDFORTH definition of <samp>READ-FILE</samp> is:</P>
<samp> <pre>
	: READ-FILE ( c-addr u1 fileid -- u2 ior )
		['] :read CATCH DUP IF
		&gt;R 2DROP zero R&gt;
		THEN
	; 
</pre> </samp>
<P>The definition is simple and it is almost all ANSI forth. The COLDFORTH 
<I>fileid</I> is the base address of an object. 
<samp>READ-FILE</samp> calls the<samp> :read</samp> method within the object. 
We have to use <samp>CATCH</samp> as the COLDFORTH device standard allows the 
device methods to abort on failure. The <samp>READ-FILE</samp> description 
requires an <I>ior</I> code on error.  <samp>CATCH</samp> is an elegant solution.
The abort is converted converted to a stack error. CATCH is a terrific idea.</P>

<P>Defining methods that have different actions in derived classes is called 
POLYMORPHISM. For some reason OOP programming has developed a jargon that 
seems to aim to confuse.
</P>
<P>Obviously for the <samp>READ-FILE</samp> code to be efficient, runtime lookup 
of the :read method has to be fast. This is the case for the OOP program model 
presented by Anton.</P>
<P>All the FORTH I/O words can be built up from methods implemented in the 
standard COLDFORTH driver. The file words take the object address from the stack. 
Words such as <samp>EXPECT</samp> and <samp>TYPE </samp>take their object address 
from a user variable. For example the definition of <samp>TYPE</samp> is:</P>
<pre> <samp> 
	: TYPE ( addr num--)
		'output_file @ :type
	;
</samp> </pre>
<P><samp>‘output_file</samp> is the user variable where the address of the object 
opened for output is stored. <samp>TYPE</samp> like the device methods is allowed 
to ABORT on failure. This leads to a definition that is even cleaner than the 
definition for <samp>READ-FILE</samp>. <samp>:type</samp> is defined for serial 
devices and block devices, there is only one real difference between 
<samp>TYPE</samp> and <samp>WRITE-FILE</samp>. <samp>TYPE</samp> takes its object 
address from a user variable; <samp>WRITE-FILE</samp> takes it from the stack.</P>

<h3>open action close</h3>

<P>All COLDFORTH I/O operations follow the <I>open action close</I> paradigm. 
<I>Open</I> provides the object address, the <I>operations</I> require the object 
address and <I>close</I> destroys the object. In all cases the object is created 
on the heap, and <I>close</I> returns the object to free heap memory.
</P>
<P>As is common with a lot of COLDFORTH I/O words, Open comes in three flavors:</P>
<pre> <samp>
	open ( "string" --object)
	$open ( addr --object)
	Sopen ( addr n --object)
</samp> </pre>
<p>The <I>open</I> string has the form:</p>
<I><P>device/device_string</P></I>
<P>The <I>open</I> function splits the string at the first / and uses the left 
hand portion to search the device word list. If a word is found in the word 
list, it is treated as a class and used to construct an object. The construction 
process is given the address and count of the right portion of the string.</P>

<P>For example: To open a file that is stored in flash memory you would use the code:</P>

<pre><samp>open flash/directory_name/file_name</samp></pre>

<P>To open a udp client talking to machine 192.168.255.1 port 07 you use the code:</P>

<pre><samp>open udp_client/192.168.255.1/07</samp></pre>

<P>Or if you want to bind to the port and leave the machine specification for later:</P>

<pre><samp>open udp_client//07</samp></pre>

<P>In all case data can be read from the device using <samp>READ-FILE</samp>.</P>

<h3>Using classes and polymorphism to tame the TCP/IP jungle.</h3>

<P>The tcp/ip protocol field is eight bits long, in practice only a few values have 
meaning; you don’t however have to define all valid protocols at kernel 
compile time. We define the required methods with a base class and derive 
the different protocols from that class. Dispatching an ip datagram then 
becomes an exercise in searching created protocol object and presenting 
the incoming datagram to the right method in the object that handles the 
selected protocol.</P>

<P>Tcp/ip is about accepting datagram from different network interfaces, 
routing them and passing them onto other network interfaces. The routing 
routine doesn’t get involved in device details; it simply determines 
which interface should get the datagram; extracts the interface's object 
address and calls the :consume_interface method through the object, the 
routing routine doesn’t get involved in the messy details.</P>

<P>The UDP and TCP protocols requires the source address and destination address 
to create the protocol checksum, the source address is dependent on the 
interface over which the datagram is sent, the interface a datagram is sent 
is dependent on the routing tables. The routing tables are a dynamic data 
structure. If you use classes and methods the problem is simply solved, you 
add the protocol object to the data structure describing the datagram and 
have the interface object call the protocol checksum method just before 
fragmentation.</P>

<P>Classes and polymorphism have been used to break the tcp/ip stack up into 
well defined sections with clean interfaces. Once again I will mention the 
basic underlying requirement. Fast runtime binding of objects to methods.</P>

<h3>A WALK THROUGH THE IP CODE.</h3>

<h4>The routing task.</h4>
<P>If a packet is placed on the ip queue it will be removed by the routing task. 
The routing task doesn’t have to ask difficult questions or look for exceptions. 
Its life is simple. Dequeue the ip packet, extract the destination, look up 
the routing table entry for that destination. Call the 
<samp>:consume_interface </samp>method of the object pointed to by the routing 
table entry found.</P>
<P>The routing table entries contain a flag that is true if the entry is for 
a broadcast address; if it is true the <samp>:broadcast</samp> method is 
called instead of the <samp>:consume_interface </samp>method.</P>
<P>The <samp>:consume_inerface </samp>or<samp> :broadcast </samp>method will 
take the packet and deal with it as required. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="./routing_task.png" WIDTH=585 HEIGHT=256></P>
<h3>The interfaces</h3>
<P>Ip packets enter and exit the tcp/ip code through an interface. <I>Interface_common </I>
is the base class. From <I>interface_common</I> we derive <I>interface_local </I>used 
if the packet is destined for the local machine. <I>Interface_loopback</I>, is used 
if the packet was sent to the loopback address. <I>interface_nice</I> is used to get 
packets from and send packets to the ethernet, and <I>interface_rti</I> is used to 
transfer packets across the rti backplane.</P>
<h4>Ethernet interface</h4>
<P>To send a packet from one machine to another on an ethernet link the ip address 
has to be converted to a hardware address. The tcp/ip standard describes another 
protocol referred to as arp ( address resolution protocol). The arp protocol is used 
to request the mapping. The workings of this protocol are contained within the 
<I>interface_nice</I> class as it has nothing to do with the rest of the system.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="./interface_nice.png" width=634 height=310></P>
<h4>rti interface</h4>
<P>The ethernet interface is complex as the ip to hardware address translation 
involves another protocol. The rti_interface uses the low low 4 bits of the ip 
address to select a card. The rti bus being a sixteen bit bus that supports 
up to 16 I/O cards.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="./interface_rti.png" width=472 height=160></P>
<h4>Loopback interface</h4>
<P>The loopback interface is simpler again, it provides the method needed by 
the routing task to get rid of a loopback packet ( <I>:consume_interface</I>) 
performs the miscellaneous functions an interface is expected to do, such as 
filling in the source address and checksumming the protocol. Loopback interface 
then queues the packet onto the proto_queue. A loopback packet will not be 
fragmented, so the loopback interface doesn't have to get involved in de-fragmenting.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="./interface_loopback.png" width=312 height=156></P>
<h4>local interface</h4>
<P>ip packets destined for the local machine will be routed to the local interface. 
The local interface puts together fragmented datagrams and queues reconstructed 
datagrams onto the protocol queue. The protocol task takes packets from the protocol 
queue, looks up the protocol table extracts the address of the object that looks 
after the selected protocol and executes the :proto_demux method.</P>
<P>The difference between the ip_queue and the proto_queue can be summarized with 
one statement. The ip_queue sees all ip packets seen be the system. The 
proto_queue sees only those packets that are routed to the local machine.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="./interface_local.png" WIDTH=397 HEIGHT=247></P>

<h4>And the beat goes on</h4>

<P>The ip packet has arrived, it was destined for the local machine so it ended 
up on the proto_queue. The protocol task has looked at the protocol field in 
the ip header searched for a protocol demux table entry for the protocol and 
called the relevant <samp>:prot_demux</samp> method. But the beat goes on. </P>

<P>In the TCP/IP suit three protocols are significant, ICMP (internet control 
message protocol), UDP (User datgram protocol) and TCP (Reliable Stream 
Transport Service). </P>

<P>At this level ICMP is the most difficult to deal with. Many of the ICMP 
messages contain the header of the datagram that caused a problem. The ICMP 
code has to extract the ip header returned in it's data field, and return 
an error to the socket that initially sent the datagram. To do this the ICMP
code extracts the protocol of the returned datagram, searches the protocol 
demux table for the protocol and calls the relevant <samp>:proto_error</samp> method.</P>

<P>OOP has once again supplied us with a very elegant solution.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="./icmp_udp_error.png" WIDTH=651 HEIGHT=256></P>

<h4>socket demux</h4>

<P>Socket demux takes the source ip address, destination ip address, source port 
and destination port, works out which object would like to deal with the packet 
and hands it on. The icmp protocol doesn’t do a socket demux, both the udp and 
tcp protocol do. The protocol demux is done in the <samp>:proto_demux</samp> 
method or the <samp>:proto_error</samp> method. The objects consuming the packets 
are linked into a hash table. The routine searches the hash table for the desired 
entry and hands the packet to the :consume_port method. For the udp protocol the 
object that consumes packets demuxed to the socket is the io_common object 
created when the port is opened. The io_common object adds the packet to the 
data that can be read using the <samp>:read</samp> method we introduced at the start of 
this paper.</P>
<P>Tcp packets still have a way to go, the address of the object dealing with 
the socket is added to the ip data structure, and the packet queued on the 
tcp_queue, to be dealt with by the tcp task. </P>
<h3>A look at the OOP model.</h3>
<p>
I have outlined how OOP techniques have been used to tame the tcp/ip stack.
I touched on how they where used to create a very elegant structure for 
device drivers. I could just as easily have discussed how OOP techniques 
led to a very tidy file system
</p>
<p>
I have only looked at two OOP implementations in detail, Andrew McKewan's and 
Anton Ertl's. It was my view the FORTH community needed another OOP model like a 
hole in the head, I therefore tried to adapt what was there to meet our needs. We have 
developed cross compilers to the point where they could  compile code written 
using either model. So for us this was not an issue. We adopted the Anton's 
model because of its simplicity.
</p>
<h3>Anton's model</h3>
<p>
An object places the address of a data structure on the stack, nothing more.
So the rest of Anton's model doesn't care how the address of the data structure came to be. 
</p>
<samp>
'output_file @
</samp>
<p>
Is as valid as:
</p>
<samp>
object_name
</samp>
<p>
You can create an object in the dictionary, an object on the heap or an object 
on the stack, and they all behave the same way. The address of  an object is returned.
</p>
<p>
Anton's methods take an object from the stack, and locates the method using an 
offset into the method table. The runtime code is:
</p>
<pre><samp>
	DOES&gt;
		_selector_offset+ @   \ object selector_offset&lt;--
		OVER _object_map+ @ + \ object xtp&lt;-- 
		@execute
	; 
</samp></pre>
<p>
Blindly using an offset can lead to problems if two different classes have the 
same method name, but are using  different table offsets. It is a hard bug to 
find. The COLDFORTH kernel makes extensive use of word name checksums ( to be 
specific the ethernet CRC32 bit checksum), with the compiler insisting that 
all tokens used generate a unique CRC32 code. Our version of  Anton's code 
checks that the methods CRC32 matches the CRC32 code found at the table offset 
given. The runtime code becomes:</p>
<pre><samp>
	DOES&gt;
		DUP _crc_offset+  @ &gt;R
		_selector_offset+ @   \ object selector_offset&lt;--
		OVER _object_map+ @ + \ object xtp&lt;--
		DUP _object_crc  + @ R&gt; = IF
			@execute
			EXIT
		THEN
		TRUE ABORT" Object didn't contain selected method" 
	;
</samp></pre>
<p>
Yes it is slower, but it is still faster than searching a method list. As one of  
COLDFORTH's  goals is portable code this is it, it has not been 
converted to assembler.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to replace the ABORT with a table search, this converts the offset 
into a hint that will speed late binding in most cases. What we have done simply adds a 
runtime check that the object presented is valid for the method being invoked.
</p>
<p>
Anton's code did allow for compile time binding, I have re-read the source and 
found an example, the syntax is.
</p>
<samp>
[bind] object print
</samp> 
<p>
Obviously it will only work if the object exists at compile time. We have not 
used this feature in the kernel.
