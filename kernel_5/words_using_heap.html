<h5>ANS 6.2.2000 PAD</h5> 
<p>( -- c-addr )</p>
<p>
c-addr is the address of a transient region that can be used to hold data for 
intermediate processing. 
</p>
<p>
PAD has been available as scratch storage for strings since the earliest Forth 
implementations. It was brought to our attention that many programmers are
reluctant to use PAD, fearing incompatibilities with system uses. 
PAD is specifically intended as a programmer convenience, however, 
which is why we documented the fact that no standard words use it. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>COLDFORTH</strong>
To keep with the intent, the kernel does't use PAD. But then with $buffer
and kill_buffer available why would an application use it anyway.
</p>
	<pre> <code>
	#$buffer ubuffer PAD
	</code> </pre>
<p>
The buffer containing the current token. #### This really should be written 
out, there us no need to transfer data from the input buffer.
</p>
<p>
Set buffer size so it can be met with a 100hex data block.
</p>
	<pre> <code>
	 $100 _#sys_buffer_user - CONSTANT _#token_max

	\ Create the token buffer

	_#token_max ubuffer _token   
	</code> </pre>
