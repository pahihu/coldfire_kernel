<h2>COLDFORTH Heap Management</h2>
<p>
TCP/IP places unknown memory demands on a system. 
</p>
<p>
IP requires you to receive an unknown number of datagrams, of unknown 
size. The datagrams could be IP fragments. You can have an unknown number
of datagrams being reconstructed from the fragments. The number of routes is unknown. 
The number of entries in your ARP table is unknown, and so it goes.
</p>
<p>
If you are going to support TCP/IP in a manner that is close to the RFC 
requirements,  pre allocation of the memory needed for IP reception is 
difficult. You have to support <i>ALLOCATE</i> and <i>FREE</i>. 
</p>
<p>
The article describes the COLDFORTH heap management system.
