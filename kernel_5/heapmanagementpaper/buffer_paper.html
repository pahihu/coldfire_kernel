<h2>COLDFORTH Heap Management</h2>
<p>
TCP/IP places unknown memory demands on a system. 
</p>
<p>
IP requires you to receive an unknown number of datagrams, of unknown 
size. The datagrams could be IP fragments. You can have an unknown number
of datagrams being reconstructed from the fragments. The number of routes is unknown. 
The number of entries in your ARP table is unknown, and so it goes.
</p>
<p>
If you are going to support TCP/IP in a manner that is close to the RFC 
requirements,  pre allocation of the memory needed for IP reception is 
difficult. You have to support <i>ALLOCATE</i> and <i>FREE</i>. 
</p>
<p>
This article describes the COLDFORTH heap management system. 
</p>

<h3>Design Aims</h3>
<ul>
<li>Portability. All code is in FORTH.</li>
<li>Run without an MMU</li>
<li>Buffers are self describing; that is all you need to return a buffer is
 the buffers address.
</li>
<li>
Memory fragmentation is controlled.
</li>
<li>
You can work out what is going on; where and when a buffer is 
used is recorded.
</li>
<li>
As fast as possible, given the other design aims.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Dealing with fragmentation was and is the most difficult problem.
</p>

<h3>Fragmentation</h3>
Its difficult to put Humpty Dumpty back together.
<p>
A system that doesn't use a MMU for memory control has to create a small memory
area from a larger area, leaving a remainder.  When the small area is returned 
to the heap management system, there is a fair chance that the some of the 
remainder has been allocated to another task and the large area can no 
longer be reconstructed.
</p>
<p>
The COLDFORTH heap management system does not solve this problem, but the 
design makes it possible to quickly recombine buffers that are meant 
to be combined.
</p>
<p>
Two design decisions set the tone of the whole heap management package.  
Both reduce de-fragmentation costs.
</p>
<p>
Memory-blocks from which user buffers are created  are binary multiples, that 
is they have a size $40 bytes, $80 bytes, $100 bytes etc.
</p>
<p>
The address of a memory block has bits below its size  set to zero. 
That is, the address of a $80 byte memory block can have the base address 
$180, but cannot have the base address $140. The following diagram tries 
to demonstrate the reason for this restriction.
</p> 
<img src="./joining_buffer.png" HEIGHT=421 WIDTH=460 >
<p>
Because we insist that the bits below the block size are zero the first case will not happen.
</p>
<h3>The heap management system </h3>
<p>
The heap management system can be divided into two parts. The code you 
interact  with when getting or returning a buffer. And the low level task that
recombines the buffers.
</p>
<h4>The data structures</h4>
<p>
The following diagram shows a $40 byte memory block linked into the $40 byte
Empty list.
</p>
<img src="./small_buffer.png" HEIGHT=358 WIDTH=432 >

<p> 
The following is worth noting:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Every memory block starts with a system header.</li>
<li>The user buffer is shorter than the memory block</li>
<li>The address of the user buffer is after the system header</li>
<li>Memory blocks are build out of units that are binary multiple of the 
minimum memory block size.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you  use the word <i>ALLOCATE</i> you will be returned a memory block 
from one of the empty lists. For example a buffer created from a $40 byte
memory block will be returned for any <i>ALLOCATE</i> request less than $1C bytes. 
The memory block will be $40 bytes, the address returned will be after the
system header, and no matter what length requested, the usable data area 
will be $1C bytes.
</p>
<p>
Any <i>ALLOCATE</i> request greater than $1C bytes and less than $5D bytes will be 
returned a buffer created from a memory block that was linked into the 
$80 byte memory block list.
</p>
<p>
This may seem pretty dam inefficient, from a $40 byte memory block the user only 
gets $1C bytes of usable memory. If you want a $8000 byte buffer, it is created 
from a $10000 byte memory block. The heap management system has given you a usable buffer 
$7FDC bytes longer than you need.
</p>
<p>
Yep it's pretty inefficient, but it's a lot better than having your memory
broken up into a lot of small chunks that you can't put back together.
</p>
<h4>Getting the memory block</h4>
<p>
When you ask for a memory area, the heap management system first goes to the memory block list 
that has memory blocks that will just satisfy your needs. If there is no buffer 
available in the list, the buffer splitting routine 
<i><a HREF="./heap_control.html#_get_more_buffers"> _get_more_buffers</a></i>
is called. This routine will go to the next list and attempt to split a buffer form that list into two. 
If there is no buffer in that list it will go to the next list and .......
<i>_get_more_buffers</i> is a recursive routine.
</p>
<p>
Life is tough for <i>_get_more_buffers</i> , the COLDFIRE heap management system has to be 
able to meet the needs of tasks running at many different priorities, 
in a manner that doesn't hold the system up.
</p>
<p>
A low level task can be using <i>_get_more_buffers</i> just to find that a high level task
has pinched the buffers created. <i>_get_more_buffers</i> has to be happy and just
do the job again, this it does.
</p>
<h4>Putting Humpty Dumpty back together</h4>
<p>
The buffer return words and the 
<i><a HREF="./kernel_tasks.html#buffer_reclaim">buffer_reclaim</a></i> 
task co-operate. The buffer return words return the buffers to the list
in an address sorted order. This may seem like an excessive runtime overhead.
Two things have to be remembered. The <i>buffer_reclaim</i> is trying to keep
the list short, and life would be very difficult for <i>buffer_reclaim</i> if
the list were not sorted.
</p>
<p>
Because the lists are sorted, because the buffers are allocated in binary multiples, and because
the bits below the memory block size have to be zero, buffer reclaim is reasonably simple.
</p>
<p>
Buffer reclaim deals with one buffer size list at a time, trying to combine and 
move the resultant buffer to the next list. If the base address of the buffer
is an acceptable address for the next list up, it checks to see if the next buffer in the list is
the next memory block ( <i><a HREF="./heap_control.html#_joinable"> _?joinable</a></i> ). 
If both these conditions are met the reclaim word joins the buffer and puts it in the next list.
</p>
<p>
Seems simple. Life gets complicated because this must occurs with high priority tasks returning and
claiming buffers. A buffer that was in the list when the test was done, may be in use by the time
joining is to occur. The complications and how they are dealt with can be seen by looking at 
the code for <i><a HREF="./heap_control.html#_join_buffer_code"> _?join_buffer_code</a></i>
</p>
<h4>Keep track of Humpty Dumpty</h4>
<p>
As soon as you introduce a heap management system, you have memory leaks. If you keep track of 
memory usage you can determine the guilty and dismiss the innocent
</p>
<p>
An abort buffer allocated to a task is linked in as shown in the following diagram.
</p>
<img src="./abort_buffer.png" HEIGHT=375 WIDTH=522 >
<p>
The used buffer list heads are only used by words that display buffer usage, for example 
<i><a HREF="./print_system_data.html#.buffers">.buffers</a></i> and
<i><a HREF="./print_system_data.html#.buffers_used">.buffers_used</a></i>.
The abort list is used to return buffers to the central pool on a task abort.
The word <i><a HREF="./heap_control.html#get_abort_buffer">get_abort_buffer ( pointer n--addr)</a></i>
allows you to supply the address of a cell that is reset to zero on a task abort. 
The cell is typically used to store the address of the buffer as shown in the diagram.
The application however is free to use it as it pleases.
</p>

<h3>application words</h3>
<p>
The COLDFIRE heap management system provides four ways of getting a memory block.

<p>
The standard gives us one way to allocate memory from the heap, COLDFORTH gives 
you four. Some may ask. What is this nonsense?.
</p>
<p>
The standard is very quiet on what happens when a task aborts. Should the memory
claimed by the task be returned, or should if be left to the programmer to 
use <i>CATCH</i> and <i>THROW</i> to return the memory in an orderly fashion. I believe the system
should reclaim the memory.  When programming you want to deal with the problem not side
issues such as this.
</p>
<p>
If <i>ALLOCATE</i> returns memory to the heap management system on an abort, 
then you need a set of words that does not. When using 
memory blocks to move data between tasks it is important that
aborting one task doesn't invalidate memory owned by another. <i>get_free_buffer</i> 
and <i>kill_free_buffer</i> are used for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
<i>get_about_buffer</i> and <i>kill_abort_buffer</i> are used to deal with data areas
created from the heap. For example:
</p>
<pre> <samp>
VARIABLE %data_pointer
: setup_task ( --)
	#data_length get_abort_buffer %data_pointer !
;

:task somthing ( --)
	setup_task
	task_action
;task
</samp> </pre>
<p>
If the task aborts the data area will be returned to the heap management system, and the cell 
containing the pointer reset back to zero.
</p>
<p><i>get_buffer</i> and <i>kill_buffer</i> are historic CVS words. 
They are a lot easier to use than <i>ALLOCATE</i> and <i>FREE</i>. 
The following code demonstrates their use.
</p>
<pre> <samp>
: do_some_stuff ( addr n --)
	DUP get_buffer
		buffer  SWAP MOVE
		$100 buffer do_stuff
			get_buffer
				\ now dealing with second buffer
				buffer do_more_stuffer
			kill_buffer
		\ now dealing with first buffer
		buffer print_stuff
	kill_buffer
;
</samp> </pre>
<p>
Basically  <i>get_buffer</i> and <i>kill_buffer</i> take the buffer address away
from the stack. There is a word ( <i>buffer</i> ) that returns the address
of the current buffer.
