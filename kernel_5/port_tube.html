Pre dates tcp/ip. Could be used to talk to tasks through dual port memeory.

</code></pre>
<p>
You can open the device and particular port with the code
port_tube/nn this code should receive the string nn. port_tube is the name of the driver.
As the open operation creates the dual port memory area
the device must be opened and closed from a task that has duel
port memory to allocate ( all owned by operator in the begining).
