Add things as you do them, than is the version change comes
after the actions on the current version.
</p>
<h4>Version 0.5</h4>
<p>
1) The file objects reworked, stucture is now a lot neater.<br>
2) NFS added<br>
3) telnet client improved ( unix client only, NT sucks)<br>
4) Some bug fixes.<br>
<h4>Version 0.7</h4>
<p>
1)More work on file objects.<br>
2)More work on telnet; moved to charater mode so it works better with NT.<br>
4)More work with telnet, function keys working.<br>
5)TCP data stream now sorted out in proto task so ^C can be made to work.<br>
6)TCP now times out properly; was no activity for a long time; now can't
  find other end for a short time. Needed for HTML server.<br>
7)Assembler now supports 5407.<br>
8)Watchdog task now works.<br>
9).objects added.<br>
10)Additional test in ?buffer.<br>
11)Ansi terminal driver.<br>
12):termination>code consistant across telnet and ttx so common drivers can be used, was a mistake.<br>
13)string_class added; needed for HTML server.<br>
14)lower case characters in hex numbers, needed for HTML server. Still not finished.<br>
</p>
<h4>Version 0.8</h4>
<p>
1)Bug in telnet_client :read.<br>
2)Floating point basic word set added.<br>
3)Q number words start with Q for example q. q.l and q.r. The Q base is now called %q_base<br>
4)pure_code changed to inline
<p>
It is getting to a stage where it is a pleasure to use.
</p>
<h4>Version0.82</h4>
<p>
1) SET-PRECISION added.<br>
2) PRECISION added.<br>
3) CONVERT return n addr instead of nd2 addr
4) The contributed MAC M* routine didn work, it has been removed. 
</p>
<h4>Version 0.83</h4>
1) Html server added<br>
2) NFS cleanup<br>
3) TCP/IP cleanup<br>
4) Move to CVS ( code version control) server<br>
5) Tasks now printsd out activation address<br>
<h4>Version 0.84</h4>
<p>
1) Nice hardware address is now random by default.<br>
2) Tasks destruction code tidied up.<br>
3) Lots of testing.<br>
All in all pretty happy with it now. I think the tcpo/ip stack is now
ready to go to war.
</p>
<h4>Version 0.85</h4>
<p>
1) Multitasker rewritten, there is now no interrupt stack. The interrupt routines
have there own stack. This solved a fallover problem. related to how the coldfire
disables interrupts on a TRAP. It had two nice side effects.<br>
a) Interupts are faster.<br>
b) The location of the stacks are known.<br>
And one negative.<br>
a) Interrupts can't be stacked.
2)Bug in write code fixed. The device was claimed in the wrong location.</br>
3)Flags to leave out the TCp/IP code and editor added for applications that
require a smaller footprint.
4) Ability to move the kernel to a space other than DRAM added.<br>
5) interrupt enable traps tidied up.<br>
<h4>Version 0.86</h4>
<p>
The boot failure sting is printed out properly.<br>
Load not attempted on cold start.
</p>
<h4>Version 0.90</h4>
<p>
Code to swap between static and DRAM for BVP's cleaned up.<br>
floating trigg functions added.<br>
</p>
<h4>Version 0.91</h4>
<p>
f2/ and f2* added.
</p>
<h4>Version 0.92</h4>
<p>
FSQRT added.
</p>
<h4>Version 0.93</h4>
<p>
1) Mistake in CREATE-FILE<br>
2)Support for BVP560 added.
</p>
<h4>Version 0.94</h4>
<p>

2)Support for BVP550 removed

5)Error in switch_cold? fixed.
6)The bank service routine changed to a port_task<br>
7)Sub directories for cards.
