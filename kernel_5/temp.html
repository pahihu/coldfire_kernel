<h2>Cross compiling uCforth</h2>
<a HREF="./license.html">license</a>
<h3>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This is the file loaded by <i>kernel.fs</i>, or <i>kernel</i>. 
if cross compiler using <b>gforth</b> load <i>kernel.fs</i>. If cross compiling from
<i>uCforth</i> start with the file <i>kernel</i>.
</p>
<p>
uCforth generates a FLAT file that can be loaded into a uClinux system of the
the selected processor. You can cross compile your own system using a uClinux
system and a distributed binary for the selected processor, or can use gforth
on a linux system to do the cross compile. The sources are hand edited html 
files that can be loaded onto a <i>gforth</i> system that has minimum html support.
When using <i>gforth</i> the html
support has to be loaded before html files are loaded.

<h4>uCforth General</h4>
<p>
uCforth is a subroutine threaded forth that runs under uClinux. The initial
version runs on the <b>COLDFIRE</b> processor. Floating point maths can be used if
the uClinux system is generated with MAC support.
</p>
<p>
The processor specific files
have been kept in a sub directory with the aim of making ports to other
processors simpler.
</p>
<h4>Using uCforth with C libraries</h4>
<p>
uCforth has been written so it can be used with C libraries. Some thought
has to be given to how these libraries are generated.
</p>
<h4>COLDFIRE</h4>
<p>
All languages have register conventions. The C language convention is very
convenient for linkage from other languages. Registers D0,D1,A0 and A1 can be
used for parameter return. All other registers are preserved. register
A7 is the stack, A6 is the linkage register. A5 is the data segment pointer.
</p>
<p>
uCforth considers D0 to D7,A0 and A1 working registers, so the use of D0,D1,A0 and A1 by
C is not a problem. A7 to A2 are used for specific purposes, as C preserves these registers how
uCforth uses them is of no interest to C.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Library</h4>
<p>
Most of the forth environment is implemented as a library. If the library access application code
the access is done using the DS ( A5 ) register as the base.
</p>
<h3>Tidy up from previous compiles</h3>
<pre>
<code>
\ reduce search order
ONLY FORTH

\ define a marker so we can get rid of this code on next cross compile
MARKER kernel_empty

\ set to zero to reduce output on xcompile
\ set to 1 to start printing out stack errors
\ set to 2 to print out tokens as compiled.
ram_variable %xdebug

2 %xdebug !

</code> </pre>
<h3> Assumption tests</h3>
<p>
When you write code you make certain assumptions. These words are
used to test the assumptions at compile time
</p>
	<pre> <code>
	: ?? ( flag --)
		ABORT" ?? has to be false" ;
	: ??= ( n1 n2 --)
		<> ABORT" ?? these have to be equal." ;
	: ??&lt; ( n1 n2 --)
		&lt; not ABORT" ?? ran out of something." ;
	: ??> ( n1 n2 --)
		&gt; not ABORT" ?? something is too small" ;
	: ??&lt;= ( n1 n2 --)
		&gt; ABORT" ?? something wrong." ;

	: ??HEX  BASE @ 10 <> ABORT" Not in hex" ;

	: ??2 ( -2 -- -2 )
		DUP -2 <> ABORT" Assembler assumptions problems"
	;

	: ??4 ( -2 -- -2 )
		DUP -4 <> ABORT" Assembler assumptions problems"
	;

	: ??6 ( -2 -- -2 )
		DUP -6 <> ABORT" Assembler assumptions problems"
	;
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Test that byte! works
</p>
<pre>
<code>
0 HERE !
\ the 11 should go
$1122 HERE byte!
\ either byte order should pass. The @ is byte order dependent.
HERE @ $22 =
HERE @ $22000000 = OR TRUE ??=
</code>
</pre>
<h3>sub directory to use</h3>
<p>
All data relevent to one port is kept in a sub directory for that port.
This results in duplication of files but a system that is lot simpler to follow.
To change the files used you change the definition of $CARD. To add a port you
add a directory for that port, copy the files closest to the processor you are
creating alter as required, add a uncommented card definition to this list,
comment out the one you are not using. And that is it.
</p>
<p>
The HTML links are to the 5272 code, this was the first created.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
CREATE $card ," ./5272/"
</code>
</pre>
<h5>Support for loading card specific sub directories</h5>
<pre>
<code>
\ word added to forth to load the card specific files.
: include_card ( --)
	#$buffer get_buffer
	$card BL WORD buffer #$buffer $+
	CR
	%xdebug @ IF

			.S ." stack on entry to "
		THEN

	buffer COUNT type
	buffer COUNT included

<h3>Load cross compiler base</h3>
<p>
Definition of the cross compiler is effectively spread through the code. A defining
word that can be used in the kernel source needs a cross compiler extension, these
are not collected in one place but generally created when the target version of the
word is created. This part of the cross compiler load gets us to a stage where we
can use the cross compiling assembler code.
</p>
<p>
The first file loads the words used to build the image. The cross compiler is built on these.
Has to be card specific as the target byte order is card specific. The host
byte order is determined when the file is loaded.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
include_card target_image.html                                  \ <a HREF="./5272/target_image.html">link</a>
\ load bFLT_maker.html before we load cross compiler
CR include ./bFLT_maker.html                                    \ <a HREF="./bFLT_maker.html">link</a>

</code>
</pre>
<p>
Cross compiling assembler for the card in question. This can be written to any standard
you like. The 68k version aborts on garbage in. The author didn't mind working out what
was valid once, remembering what is valid, no way. Let the assembler do that.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
include_card xassembler.html                                    \ <a HREF="./5272/xassembler.html">link</a>
</code>
</pre>
<p>
The ghost vocabulary needs more support than offered by ansi forth,
a new vocabulary structure is defined using ansi forth.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
include ./ghost_wordlist.html                                   \ <a HREF="./ghost_wordlist.html">link</a>
</code>
</pre>
<p>The xcompiler is built on the assembler,
this is a subroutine threaded forth, the issue of laying down the executed code
so references can be obtained is mostly avoided by laying down assembler directly.
</p>
<p>
The compiler code that is common to all  cards first, mainly memory reference stuff.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
include ./xcompiler_common.html                                 \ <a HREF="./xcompiler_common.html">link</a>
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Most of the xcompiler is specific to the card.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
include_card xcompiler.html                                     \ <a HREF="./5272/xcompiler.html">link</a>
</code>
</pre>
<p>
A few xcompiler words need to reference target code still
this file lays down that code using what has been defined.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
include_card do_code.html                                       \ <a HREF="./5272/do_code.html">link</a>
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Finish off the xcompiler.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
include_card xcompiler2.html                                   \ <a HREF="./5272/xcompiler2.html">link</a>
</code>
</pre>
<h3>File links in target</h3>
<p>
Each file load creates two dictionary entries. On file entry the file name
is put down and a reference to the name. On exit another reference is created,
the reference is to the file we are leaving to.
When we trace down the link, the first entry below the address of the word points to
the file the word come from.
</p>
<p>
Cunning modern technology results us
being able to create a linked list in the target and
not have to patch it.
This is a host word that creates a entry in the data segment
and adds a bFLT reference
This word can be found in the target so we need to use a nice target
name.
