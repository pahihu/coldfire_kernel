<h4>packet structure</h4>
<p>
The ip packet is structured as shown below. An application 
that uses queue_ip packets must understand this, as room has to be left 
at the start of the packet for the ep header and the ip header. This has to be,
we do not want to be doing block moves as we move the packet up/down the protocol stack.
</p>
<img src="./pep.png" HEIGHT=373 WIDTH=277>
<ul>
<li>pep = pointer_external_packet</li>
<li>pip = pointer_internet_packet</li>
<li>pd = pointer_data</li>
</ul>
<h4>IP packet flow</h4>
<p>
All ip packets are queued into the IP packet queue. This is a priority queue,
with the packet priority field ( contained in the ip header) giving which queue level 
the packet is queued onto. All interfaces have a :queue_ip method. The queue_ip method
expects a correctly formed ip packet. The following ip fields must be 
filled in
<ul>
<li>HLEN</li>
<li>SERVICE TYPE</li>
<li>TOTAL LENGTH</li>
<li>TIME TO LIVE</li>
<li>PROTOCOL</li>
<li>DESTINATION IP ADDRESS</li>
<li><i>protocol_object</i> field must be set to a valid protocol object or be zero</li>
</ul>
<p> If  IP options are to be used they must be written in th data field and HLEN set
to reflect there existance. <i>queue_ip</i> is a low level word, applications that use it 
must deal with the complications.
</p>
<p>
Routed will.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the destination address to determine which interface to send the packet to.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the packet is queued with a source address of zero, routed will:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the source to the ip address of the interface the packet is routed to.</li>
<li>Execute the <i>:protocol_checksum</i> method. Some  protocols cannot create</li>
there checksum until the source address is known.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the packet is queued with a source address routed assumes that the packet was
sourced elsewhere.
</p>
<img src="./ip_packet_flow.png" HEIGHT=489 WIDTH=849>
<p>
All ip packets are taken from the ip packet queue, there is no special path for local or
broadcast packets. The routing routine will determine a destination interface using
the destination ip address. For local broadcast addresses it will be 
the broadcast_interface. For local addresses it will be a local_interface. 
For a remote adddress is will be a interface that can send ip packets off card.
</p>
<h4>Address resolution protocol</h4>
<p>
The address resolution protocol ( ARP) is only required if the hardware address 
cannot be determined from the IP address, as an example ethernet. 
:consume_interface will deal with the problem. It is also consume_interface's problem to fragment or defragment 
the packet if required. The local interface will defragment, interfaces that send packets
over the wire will fragment.
We do it in consume_interface so that the full outgoing record goes through routed,
and the hardware address only has to be resolved for the larger packet. We defragment in the 
local consume_interface method because it is only then that we know the packet has 
to be reconstructed.
 
We have to do it at consume_interface as write_pep ( the word one layer down)
can be sending packets other than ip. It is also consume_interface that has to convert 
the ip header into network order, and checksum the header.We don't muck around 
with incremental checksum updates. Such things also have to allow for ip options.
