The coldfire doesn't have hardware to support the supervisor 
stack pointer. This is done in software as tasks should not 
have to make allowances for interrupt code. As it is tasks 
will have 8 bytes put on there stacks by interrupt code.

Variable to save the return stack value when we switch back to
user state
</p>
	<pre> <code>
	ram_variable _%int_stack_pointer
	</code> </pre> 
<p>
Without hardware support for the user stack pointer interrupt entry is a little
more complex
</p>
<p>
You have to swap to interrupt stack on interrupt, to do otherwise is to
require very large task stacks.
</p>
<p>
_%int_stack_pointer and _%int_stack_in_use have to be indivisiable correct
so when being altered interrupts have to be disabled. Also level seven cannot
use the interrupts stack.
</p> 
<p>
Level 7 cannot use the super stack
</p>
<p>
We leave thsi word with interrupts disabled, it is up to the rest of the code
to set interrupts at the required level.

The interrupt code can raise the multitasker priority level. When you switch from interrupt
to user state you have to check and if that has occured, raise the multitasker priority.
