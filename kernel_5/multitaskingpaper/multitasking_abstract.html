<h2>COLDFORTH Multitasking</h2>
<p>
If a computer is controlling a machine, TCP/IP should have a low priority. 
Stopping the machine at limit switches, generating a nice function output; 
they are all things of greater importance. What does it matter if a couple 
of datagrams are lost, the network has probable dropped some anyway. 
</p>
<p>
COLDFORTH supports preemptive multitasking and places TCP/IP communication priority 
one level above the lowest level. The lowest level is used for user input.
Both levels are below the priority levels used to control machinery. 
</p>
<p>
TCP/IP requires the timeout of routes, the timeout of ARP entries, timeout of 
defragmentation attempts, and the detection of TCP inaction. All these functions are placed in 
tasks that sit on the lowest priority level along with terminal input and 
buffer defragmentation. Getting the data through has a higher priority.
</p>
<p>
This article looks at why a preemptive multitasking is important and how it is implemented 
in COLDFORTH.
