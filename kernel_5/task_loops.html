<h5>Task level names</h5>
<p>
	The task levels are given names so that magic numbers do not have to be
	used in following code.
</p>

<p>
Different interrupts restart the schedular at differnt levels. 
The level is scheduled when the system switches from supervisor to user.
Interrupt routines need to be kept short for this model to work.
Try to do as little as possible in interrupts and schedule a task to do most of the work.
</p>
