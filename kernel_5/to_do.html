In rti device add to to make sure we are running from a port task.

1) #Done# Correct "system_entry" and "system_rte" - very important!

2) Add terminal facility to Stage_I via bank memory.

3) # Not an issue# Bank memory: currently you are using bank 3, you mentioned that you wished to use bank 0 and for me to use
1, 2 and 3. Do you still want to do this?

4) There seems to be a problem with all types of emitting words. Specifically, I came across "CR", "TAB" and ".".
Currently I redefined these words in the application by adding a "send" after each word. Is this ok? Note also a
space is missing after the "." word.

5) The "empty" word is still not 100% ok. If a task is defined empty does not appear to work to well...You have
to empty twice. Also activating the "empty" command while operating in &tasks will kill the system.

6) The ability to kill a task in interrupt code...wishful thinking on my part.

7) A more user friendly way to destroy a task.

8) Rename interrupt levels - something more generic. Also, currently we have to fetch the interrupt head from
xheads...This could be made more user friendly.


Currently the application overwrites the control register for CS2 through to CS6. Should this continue?

11) Currently BUS-ERROR is enabled by the application...Should this continue?

12) Currently the IMR register is overwritten by the application...Should this continue?

#done# 13) Assembler:
#had been fixed# a) Check address offset if within limits ie. +127 to -128 and +32767 to -32768


#bug found# b) Check address offset in BSR instruction if over +32767 to -32768
#bug in MULU only# c) Check long word MULU/MULS as per immediate value mode. Immediate values are
only allowed in word operations not LONG WORD.
#was ok# d) Ditto above to DIVU/DIVS. I think its ok...but would be good if you check.

14) Something to perhaps to think about...determining which coldfire mask we are using and setting an
appropriate variable. IE. a %Coldfire_mask variable.

15) #Done# Check application flash; Formatting. Reading and writing.

16) Correct file size error when loading via terminal ie. re Maths_Functions.4th. I have not had this problem when
loading from the front serial ports or on Stage_I.

17) Addition: it would be nice if you add a word like .TASKS from the old system.

18) Addition: it would also be nice if you make the heading and title variables accessible.

19) System stack into static ram.

20) ed doesn't work

21) edit_close leaves a value on stack and file doesn't doesn't come up

22) `````````````````dir abort should close file

23) Copy over file aborts correctly but all files are not closed.

24) Not releasing free buffers

25) Make buffer area bigger in BVP
