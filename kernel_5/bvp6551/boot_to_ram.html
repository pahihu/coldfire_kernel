The bvp6651 coldforth is loaded by a boot loader, the boot loader has already setup dram, the chip selects, 
parallel port bit select and has copied the image into DRAM. This file is reduced to patching the 
address of _start_up into address 4 of the image.
</p>

<p>
Change the address so it is a boot prom reference.
patch it into the start of dram executing code.
